# HootAndCompute Project Overview

## Introduction
HootAndCompute is FTC Team 24123's repository for the INTO THE DEEP (2024-2025) competition season. This repository contains a modified version of the FTC SDK that supports Kotlin development, making it easier and more efficient to develop robot code.

## Project Philosophy
**THINK CRITICALLY | DEBUG CREATIVELY | ACT COMPASSIONATELY**

These core values guide the development and teamwork approach for the HootAndCompute team.

## Key Components

### 1. Volt Library
Volt is a powerful, extendable, and easy-to-use library developed by HootAndCompute for FTC robot programming. It provides abstractions and utilities that simplify robot development.

### 2. TeamCode
Contains the actual robot code implementation, including:
- Robot definitions
- Attachments (mechanisms and subsystems)
- OpModes (autonomous and teleop programs)

### 3. Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available to help team members and other FTC teams understand how to use the codebase effectively. The documentation includes:
- Getting started guides
- Reference documentation
- Guides for creating robots, attachments, and manual modes
- Simplified components for quick implementation

## Project Structure
- **FtcRobotController**: Standard FTC robot controller code
- **TeamCode**: Custom robot implementation code
- **Volt**: Custom library for FTC development
- **docs**: Project documentation
- **.junie**: Project guidelines and standards

## Development Workflow
1. Understand the requirements for the robot or feature
2. Design the solution using Volt's abstractions
3. Implement the solution in Kotlin
4. Test thoroughly on the robot hardware
5. Document the implementation for future reference

## Getting Started
To get started with development, refer to the [documentation](https://kingssack.github.io/HootAndCompute/) which provides detailed guides and API references.

## Contributing
Contributions to the codebase should follow the team's coding standards and be reviewed by team members before being merged into the main codebase.
