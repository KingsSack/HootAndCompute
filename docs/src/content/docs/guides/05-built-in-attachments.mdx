import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Volt has several built-in `Attachment`s that can be used to quickly add functionality to your `Robot`.

These `Attachment`s include:

1. `DcMotorAttachment`
2. `ServoAttachment`
3. `CRServoAttachment`
4. `CRServoWithPotentiometerAttachment`

All four can be used as is, however, they can also be extended to add more functionality.

## Using Built-In `Attachment`s

There are two main ways to use a simple attachment:

1. As-is
2. Extended

### As-is

To use an `Attachment` as-is, simply create a new instance of the `Attachment` in your `Robot` class.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin {4}
class MyRobot(hardwareMap: HardwareMap) : Robot(hardwareMap) {
    private val clawServo by servo("clawServo")

    val claw = ServoAttachment("Claw", clawServo)
}
```

</TabItem>

### Extended

To extend an `Attachment`, create a new class that inherits the `Attachment`.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin "ServoAttachment("Claw", servo)"
class Claw(servo: Servo) : ServoAttachment("Claw", servo) {
    // Custom functionality can be added here
}
```

</TabItem>
