Simple attachments are pre-made attachments in [Volt](../../api/Volt) meant to make development quicker and simpler.

## What are Simple Attachments?

There are three main simple attachments:

1. [SimpleAttachmentWithDcMotor](../../api/Volt/dev.kingssack.volt.attachment/-simple-attachment-with-dc-motor)
2. [SimpleAttachmentWithCrServo](../../api/Volt/dev.kingssack.volt.attachment/-simple-attachment-with-cr-servo)
3. [SimpleAttachmentWithServo](../../api/Volt/dev.kingssack.volt.attachment/-simple-attachment-with-servo)

All three can be used as is, however, they can also be extended to add more functionality.

## Using Simple Attachments

There are two main ways to use a simple attachment:

1. As-is
2. Extended

### As-is

To use a simple attachment as-is, simply create a new instance of the attachment in your robot class.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin {2}
class ExampleRobot(hardwareMap: HardwareMap, initialPose: Pose2d) : Robot(hardwareMap, initialPose) {
    val motor = SimpleAttachmentWithDcMotor(hardwareMap, "motorName")
}
```

### Extended

To extend a simple attachment, create a new class that inherits the simple attachment.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin "SimpleAttachmentWithDcMotor(hardwareMap, name)"
class ExampleAttachment(hardwareMap: HardwareMap, name: String) : SimpleAttachmentWithDcMotor(hardwareMap, name) {
    init {
        // Reverse the motor
        motor.direction = DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE
    }
}
```
